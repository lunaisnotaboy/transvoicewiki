## A Note On Terminology
In this guide, I will be using "male", "female", and versions of those to describe the typical voice society gives to cis men and women. This is not in any way saying that you cannot have a typical "male" or "female" voice if you are not male or female. This is just an easier way to do terminology and for more people to understand. If you have any suggestions for more inclusive terminology, please add them!

## Resonance

Despite what you may first think, training your voice isn't about changing pitch as much as it is about changing the resonance. For example, if you hear a man with a high voice, you can still identify it as a "male" voice. And if you hear a girl with a deep voice, you can still identify it as a "girls" voice.
