# Introduction
<!-- Don't mind the extra introduction, it's required for the page -->
Transgender voices resources are really hard to find on the internet, especially good ones, so I decided to remake a (now-defunct) website originally made by my friend [jo!](https://j0.lol/).

## A Small Notice
<!-- space idk -->
Currently, this wiki is transfem focused, so I really don't have much on transmasc, sorry!
